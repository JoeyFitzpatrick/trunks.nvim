### Git pull can't rebase multiple branches
Sometimes when using the `git pull` mapping in a UI, instead of pulling, there is an error that says `can't rebase onto multiple branches`. This usually goes away after pulling a second or third time. It would be nice if this just didn't happen at all. I think this has something to do with `git fetch` or some other background command running, because sometimes this occurs even when I just open Trunks and use pull without switching branches.
