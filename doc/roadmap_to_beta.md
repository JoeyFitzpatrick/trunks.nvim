# Roadmap to Beta
At the time of this writing, Trunks.nvim is in alpha. This document shows what features, bug fixes, and improvements are needed for Trunks.nvim to get to beta.

While the project is in alpha, we will not use versioning. Once all of the improvements in this document are either accomplished or de-prioritized, we'll do a beta release with version 0.1.0. We also need to release on luarocks once we hit beta.

## Features

### Git restore hunk/lines/file from previous commit
In a file from a previous commit, be able to:
* visually select lines to restore
* restore the entire file

In a git patch, be able to do the above, as well as:
* restore a single hunk

### Allow users to create custom command mappings
Create autocmds for different UIs, so that keymaps could be created for a given UI as part of its autocmd. Not a huge fan of this approach, but there might be other reasons to create these autocmds anyways.

### Quickfix list integration
Some ideas for quickfix list integrations that would be helpful:

- Fugitive has a `:Gclog` command that would be nice to copy.
- A git grep integration would be nice.

## Improvements

### Git pull can't rebase multiple branches
Sometimes when using the `git pull` mapping in a UI, instead of pulling, there is an error that says `can't rebase onto multiple branches`. This usually goes away after pulling a second or third time. It would be nice if this just didn't happen at all. I think this has something to do with `git fetch` or some other background command running, because sometimes this occurs even when I just open Trunks and use pull without switching branches.

### Git log -S with multiline visual selection
It would be awesome if using `:G log -S` from visual mode worked with a multiline selection. One way this _could_ work is to use concepts from [this blog post](https://hoelz.ro/blog/applying-gits-pickaxe-option-across-multiple-lines-of-yaml-using-textconv). The gist of it is:
* create a script that replaces new lines in a diff with a string like `\n`
* pass this to the `log` command using the `-c` flag
* pass the `--pickaxe-regex` option to the command to ignore any whitespace changes between lines

This is hilariously over-the-top, but it would be pretty cool.

### Git log --graph
Make `:G log --graph` highlight the graph characters and actually fetch the commits for keymaps. There's a plugin that exists that we could make an integration for, or we could just do a really simple version ourselves.

### Git diff keymaps
When using a command like `:G show abc123`, there are keymaps that allow for opening files and diffs for a the given commit. It would be nice to have the same keymaps for `:G diff abc123`. For `show`, there are maps to open a file at the given commit, or at the commit _before_ the given commit. For `diff`, we'd probably want to use that, but also support a commit range or multiple given commits, so in the case of `:G diff commit1 commit2`, the "previous" file would be `commit1`.

### Quiet commands
In git, many commands take a `--quiet` flag that surpresses informational messages. It would be nice to have this work for `:G` commands, so running a command like `:G checkout some-branch --quiet` should not open a split, for instance.

### Reblame handles files not in commit
When reblaming a file that has a different name at a given commit, a pretty ugly error is shown. We should handle that more gracefully by either figuring out the old file name, or if that's not possible, show a better error.
